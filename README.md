### Maybe you dont have npm

#### On macos
First install brew\
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`\

#### On Windows
[get instaler](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### On Linux
I think your distro have a package to install, like\
`yum install npm`\
or\
`apt install npm`

#### On strange Linux
if you have a strange linux like me, you need a node script for install\
and make alias on the script for node repo thinks you are using a normal distro like ubuntu or centos\
on line 282\
`check_alt "deepin" "unstable" "Ubuntu" "xenial"`\
